# BreadBot
Welcome to BreadBot! A swiss army knife of a bot that is aimed towards a twitch streamer! Using BreadBot should be
simple and come easily between setup to launching all systems within seconds. Check back as I develop the bot over
the next few months and will eventually release beta builds when I feel it can be run well.
